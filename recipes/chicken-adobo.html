		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Filipino chicken adobo is a popular and flavorful dish from the Philippines. It features chicken pieces marinated and simmered in a savory blend of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. The marinade not only infuses the chicken with rich flavors but also creates a delicious, tangy sauce. Often served with steamed white rice, chicken adobo is known for its balance of salty, sour, and slightly sweet tastes, making it a beloved comfort food in Filipino cuisine. My favorite.</p>
