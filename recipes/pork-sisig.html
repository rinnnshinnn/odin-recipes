			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p class="adjust-font-size">Pork sisig is a popular Filipino dish made from parts of the pig’s head and liver, usually seasoned with calamansi (a local citrus fruit), onions, and chili peppers. The meat is typically boiled, grilled, and then finely chopped before being served on a sizzling platter. The dish is known for its crispy texture and savory, tangy flavor, often garnished with a raw egg on top, which cooks from the residual heat. Pork sisig is commonly enjoyed as a pulutan (appetizer) with drinks or as a main dish with rice.</p>

				<li>Now start heating up your grill. Put the meat you prepared earlier on the grill, and cook them for 5 minutes. Then turn them to the other side, and repeat the previous step. Transfer the cooked pig parts to a separate container, and let it cool down.</li>
				<li>Remember the dressing components we discussed earlier? Combine all of these together in a bowl. Make sure to mix them thoroughly.</li>
				<li>Now chop up the pig parts you grilled earlier. Get them in small pieces, and place these in a large mixing bowl. Pour in your dressing mixture. Then just toss everything together until they are all well-blended</li>
